# Random Astrology Message Generator

## Description: 

This project is a completely random message generator that randomly selects a star sign, characteristics of any star sign, and also gives a random quote of encouragment for what to do that day. It is quite useless as the chracteristics do not match the star signs and neither do the encouraging quotes. There is also a hidden easter egg which is the lion artwork if leo is found as I am a Leo.

## Features: 

This is a single use javascript app which only produces one quote to the console of the star sign, 3 random characteristics, a random quote of encouragement and a possible easter egg.

## How to Use

Use an IDE or bash to run the javascript program. You will need to have Node installed to run the javascript outside of a broswer.

Technologies 

- javascript
- Node
- Visual Studio (Terminal) or bash

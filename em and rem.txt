em (relative to the parent element's font size):
When em is used for the font-size property of an element, its value is relative to the font-size of its parent element.
When em is used for other properties (like padding, margin, width, height), its value is relative to the font-size of the element itself.
Compounding effect: Because em values are relative to their parent, nesting elements with em units can lead to a compounding effect where font sizes and other dimensions can become unexpectedly large or small as you go deeper into the document structure.
Example:
Code

.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 * 16px = 24px */
  padding: 0.5em; /* 0.5 * 24px = 12px */
}
2. rem (relative to the root element's font size):
rem stands for "root em" and its value is always relative to the font-size of the root <html> element of the document.
This provides a consistent base for all rem units throughout your stylesheet, regardless of the parent element's font size.
Predictability and accessibility: rem units are generally preferred for most sizing because they are more predictable and simplify responsive design. They also improve accessibility by respecting the user's default browser font size settings, as the root <html> element's font size often defaults to the browser's base font size (typically 16px).
Example:
Code

html {
  font-size: 16px; /* Base font size for rem units */
}

.element {
  font-size: 1.2rem; /* 1.2 * 16px = 19.2px */
  margin-top: 1rem; /* 1 * 16px = 16px */
}
In summary:
Use rem for consistent, global scaling of elements based on a single root font size.
Use em when you need an element's size to be relative to its immediate parent's font size, which can be useful for component-based design where elements need to scale contextually.

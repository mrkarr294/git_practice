Goal: Design a random astrology message generator

Features:
- All 12 signs will be featured
-There will be 12 characteristics for each sign
-There will be a final message displayed to encourage what to do for the displayed

Notes:
-Each sign, characteristic, and message are randomly chosen. This means that the characteristics given to that sign might be from a completely different sign.
-The signs will be stored in an array as an object.
-Each sign should be an object that also contains different characteristics
-The final messages will be stored in a seperate array and again chosen randomly.
